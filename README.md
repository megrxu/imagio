# `immi`

`immi` is a web application that allows you to store and manage private images using [Cloudflare Images](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-images/) and [Cloudflare Pages ↗](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/) with the help of [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) framework.

To build and deploy ImmI, follow the steps below:

2. Set up environment variables (the `ACCOUNT_ID` and a read-write API token `CF_IMAGES_API_KEY`) in your Cloudflare dashboard.
3. Publish your pages.

## Endpoints
